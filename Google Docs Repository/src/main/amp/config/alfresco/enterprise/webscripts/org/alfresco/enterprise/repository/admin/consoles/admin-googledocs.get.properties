googledocs.enabled.description=Enables the Google Docs functionality. When you install Alfresco Content Services with the setup wizard, this property is set to true. If you set this option to false, the Edit in Google Docs action will not be available. Documents that are currently being edited will still be available using the Resume editing in Google Docs action until they are saved or discarded.
integration.googleDocs.idleThresholdSeconds.label=Google Docs Idle Threshold
integration.googleDocs.idleThresholdSeconds.description=Sets the idle time threshold in seconds. Additional Google users that you invite to collaborate on the document will be considered to be idle after this period. The period is measured from the time when the user last made a change to the document. When saving documents back to Alfresco Share, or discarding changes, you must confirm that you want to disconnect any non-idle users before the action completes.
